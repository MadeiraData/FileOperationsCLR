/*
 Pre-Deployment Script Template	For Importing a Signed CLR Assembly (SSDT Project)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to use this script, you must configure the following SQLCMD Variables in your project:

$(PathToSignedDLL)
$(CLRKeyName)
$(CLRLoginName)

To configure your SQLCMD Variables: Right-click on your DB project, select "Properties", and go to "SQLCMD Variables".
Add your new SQLCMD Variables in the grid.

The $(PathToSignedDLL) variable is particularly tricky, because it requires you to know, in advance,
the path to your signed assembly DLL. That file may not be available until after you first build your project.
Consistent file paths must be maintained, especially when using CI/CD pipelines.

To sign your assembly:
Right-click on your DB project, select "Properties", and go to "SQLCLR".
Click on the "Signing..." button.
Enable the "Sign the assembly" checkbox.
Using the dropdown box, choose an existing strong name key file (*.snk) or create a new one.
Set a password for the key file.
This password is required for this phase only (initial signing config).
If you plan to use the same strong name key file for other assemblies, make sure to save your password.
